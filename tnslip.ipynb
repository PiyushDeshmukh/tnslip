    "Python was designed by [Guido Van Rossum](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum), who currently works at Dropbox, and is also known as BDFL, i.e. Benevolent Dictator For Life in the python community for his continues contributions in the process of Python development. Python is a multi-paradigm language, which was basically designed for .........  well idk, I can't see any specific area to point out, but can see almost everywhere.\n",

    "Python focuses a lot on readability. As it is said, \"A code is written once, but read many times.\", python focuses on both, the writability and the readability. With respect to writability, I mean that the speed of development of a project in python is generally higher than that of any other language. Program performance matters, but programmer performance also matters equally. Quoting [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), \"Premature optimization is the root of all evil\". As python is a high level language, i.e. you need not to go into low level implementation of something. Implementing something is quick, and saves a lot of time, the time that you could have lost during maintainance because you were unnecessarily optimizing something that wasn't of enough worth. You can start and easily reach a working model. On the same side, readability is also one of the main purpose of writing code in python, maintainance is painless, and far more less frustating than other languages. Ofc, this has to do a lot with your code writing habits, but it always counts for each language, so makes no difference here. Writing bad code in python is possible, but that is not what is preferable, if you stick to conventions, you will be happy, atleast happier than the programmers of other langauges."

So instead of you reading a lot of things on Internet about which one to choose, I would suggest that unless you are bound by some constraints always go with python3. If you looking forward to learn python, then python3 should be the choice. If you are going to develop something from scratch, do it in python3. However, in case you are working on something that requires support from a module that has been written for python2 and not python3, you don't have a choice. Developers don't switch to python3 because they don't want to break their code, because either the code has been written for python2 or it is dependent on modules designed for python2. FYI, linux ships with both python2 as well as python3, however, python2 is the default, and is recommended not to change it for the same reason.\n",

    "As shown above, `longer` is rebinded to a new list object inside the function, as a result, there are no changes reflected to the outer scope! Although changing the arguments passed to a function is not generally what we want, as these accidental changes in values in the outer scope is call of debugging! However, there are some cases in which you may find it handy to use. There are some built-in functions especially designed to do this! For instance, we have a `sorted()` function, which returns a new list object in the sorted form. In case, you wish to do something like `my_list = sorted(my_list)`, then `my_list.sort()` is more of what you want."

    "Another interesting feature of python is that it allows you to pause and resume the execution of a function. Such a construct is rather termed  as generator. A generator is differentaited from a function from the keyword `yield`. The `yield` statement basically allows you to pause the execution of a function by returning a value to the calling statement. Then the control flow goes as usual unless the function is called again. This time, when the function is called, the function resumes its execution from the statement right next where it paused earlier, and then continues the execution unless it encounters the next yield statement. It should be noted that the variables in the function scope retain their latest values everytime. So if a variable has been modified earlier, then its modiffied value is available to us everytime we call the function (and ofc unless we modify it again).\n",

    "Generators become handy in cases when you want to consume less memory. For instance, if you call the `fib()` function to return many fibonacci numbers, like greater than a million, you obviously don't want it to return a list, as it shall make a huge memory consumption, instead you find for something that can return you the next fibonacci number whenever required on the fly, this way you can perform even better in terms of memory. This can easily be achieved with the help of generators, however, you get a drawback of this. As there is always a tradeoff, you pay for time when you attempt to reduce memory consumption. The same goes with the use of generators where you pay for speed because everytime you demand for the next returned value, the execution of the generator is resumed and carried out. Therefore, before it can continue executing current instructions, your CPU executes the instructions inside the generator to obtain the next value demanded dynamically. Later when it encounters the `yield` statement, it continues the execution from just after where the call was made."

They are used to wrap functions, so as to do some setup and teardown activities, or caching stuff, or counting function calls, or checking for pre/post conditions, or generating deprecation warnings or I dont know all, there are many other things. Oh, did I say decorators? I didn't mean to introduce so early! But now since you already know about them, let me continue. Decorators are another (although funny and/or useless for some people) good things that python provides. It basically wraps a function. Below is a decorator that memoizes the return values of our `nth_root()` function. This helps us speeding up the execution of our function especially when it is called multiple times with same arguments."

We use `cache` as a dictionary which maps a particular input argument combination as a key to the corresponding return value of the function. If we had a value stored in the `cache` we return that value, else we make the function call since it is the first time that argument combination has been encountered, so we process it.
