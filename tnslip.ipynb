So instead of you reading a lot of things on Internet about which one to choose, I would suggest that unless you are bound by some constraints always go with python3. If you looking forward to learn python, then python3 should be the choice. If you are going to develop something from scratch, do it in python3. However, in case you are working on something that requires support from a module that has been written for python2 and not python3, you don't have a choice. Developers don't switch to python3 because they don't want to break their code, because either the code has been written for python2 or it is dependent on modules designed for python2. FYI, linux ships with both python2 as well as python3, however, python2 is the default, and is recommended not to change it for the same reason.\n",

A generator is differentaited from a function from the keyword `yield`. The `yield` statement basically allows you to pause the execution of a function by returning a value to the calling statement. Then the control flow goes as usual unless the function is called again. This time, when the function is called, the function resumes its execution from the statement right next where it paused earlier, and then continues the execution unless it encounters the next yield statement.

This can easily be achieved with the help of generators, however, you get a drawback of this. As there is always a tradeoff, you pay for time when you attempt to reduce memory consumption. The same goes with the use of generators where you pay for speed because everytime you demand for the next returned value, the execution of the generator is resumed and carried out. Therefore, before it can continue executing current instructions, your CPU executes the instructions inside the generator to obtain the next value demanded dynamically.
