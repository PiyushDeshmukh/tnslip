# tnslip

tnslip or "the not so long introduction to python" is a casual read that has been designed in free time, so that people with
a little programming background can give this a read. I don't guarantee but have made my best efforts to encorporate good 
things/habits that I know.

To be noted, this read is not a substitute of a tutorial, it is just a casual introduction/talk which focuses on some good parts
(or may be many parts) of python embedding the do(s) and don't(s).

## Contribute
I know, I amn't expert, and no one is born perfect. There are chances of many mistakes creeping in. So feel free to contribute 
to this repo by correcting what you think as wrong, or adding what you think as good. I have deliberately not given a logical
structure to this document or divided it into modules or headings. I just wanted it to be casual reading. So when contributing,
please keep this in mind and please don't break that.

As for now, I haven't even completed it yet, and am trying to get this on a position so as to cover most of the functionality of python.
